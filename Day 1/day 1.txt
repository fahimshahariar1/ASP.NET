Asp.net is a robust web framework for building modern, fast, and secure web apps.
  I am starting this module now after the completion of the C# learning module. Which you can find here https://github.com/fahimshahariar1/C-sharp-learning-module

For this particular module, I am using the tutorials or teaching from the official .net website.
Which can also be found: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/blazor-introduction/1-introduction


this is obviously the frontend tutorial there will also be a tutorial or part for backend development.
Which I will be following soon after finishing this module

in summary, what we have learned today is

Blazor is a modern web framework based on .NET that allows developers to build interactive web applications using HTML, CSS, and C#. It offers a component-based approach for creating reusable UI elements, enabling rapid development and efficient maintenance.

Key features and benefits of Blazor include:

Reusable components: Build web applications using pre-built or custom components for faster development.
Rich interactivity: Handle UI events and implement component logic using C#.
Single development stack: Use .NET for both frontend and backend development.
Efficient rendering: Blazor optimizes UI updates for performance.
Server and client-side rendering: Choose between server-side rendering for SEO and client-side rendering for interactivity.
Progressive enhancement: Gradually enhance the user experience of server-rendered applications.
Interop with JavaScript: Integrate with existing JavaScript libraries and APIs.
Great tooling: Use Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code for efficient development.
Cross-platform: Build web, mobile, and desktop applications using Blazor.
Blazor is well-suited for web development projects that require:

High productivity and efficiency.
A unified development stack.
.NET expertise.
Performance and scalability.
However, Blazor might not be the best choice if:

Download size and load time are critical.
Extensive integration with a different frontend framework is needed.
Support for older web browsers is required.
