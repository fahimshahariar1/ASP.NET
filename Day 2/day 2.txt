Why Blazor?
Blazor allows you to create interactive web UIs with reusable components using C#, HTML, and CSS. It offers several benefits:

High productivity: Build web applications faster with pre-built or custom components.
Rich interactivity: Handle UI events and implement component logic using C#.
Unified development stack: Use .NET for both frontend and backend development.
Performance and scalability: Blazor is optimized for efficient rendering and supports various architectures.
This module is ideal if you're looking for a productive web development solution using C# and .NET.

Setting Up Your Development Environment
To start building Blazor apps, you'll need:

.NET SDK: Download and install the .NET SDK from the .NET website. It provides tools for creating, building, and running .NET projects.
Code Editor: Choose between Visual Studio (a fully featured IDE) or Visual Studio Code (a lightweight code editor with a Blazor extension).
The module provides instructions for creating a new Blazor web app project using Visual Studio.

Blazor Components
Blazor applications are built from reusable components. These components define the UI structure and handle user interactions. Razor (.razor) files are used to create Blazor components. They combine HTML for the UI and C# code for rendering logic and event handling.

Key concepts covered in this section include:

Razor syntax: Mixing HTML with C# for component definition.
Component usage: Using components within other components with HTML-style tags.
Component parameters: Passing data to components for customization.
@code block: Adding C# code to components for state management, lifecycle methods, and event handlers.
Building a Basic Blazor App
The module guides you through creating a simple Blazor application with two pages:

Home page: Displays a welcome message.
Counter page: Implements a counter that increments a value upon button click.
This exercise demonstrates creating and using Razor components, including modifying components with parameters.
